## Overview

I have recently become a franchise owner at Maven Roasters, a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City.
To better understand purchase behavior and streamline operations, I collected transactional data from January 2023 to Jun 2023. The project goal is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for the business.

### Objectives:
- Profile and prepare the raw data for analysis.
- Explore the data using Excel PivotTables.
- Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends.

### Data source: 
The data set is a collection of transaction records from a fictitious coffee shop in New York City.

### Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel: Calculated Fields, PivotTables, Pivot Charts, Slicers

## Analysis

- The coffee shop dataset is explored, basic QA and profiling are conducted, and calculated date and time fields are added to prepare data for analysis.
- The data is sliced and diced with Excel PivotTables, and views are created to analyze time series and product-level trends.
- The following are some of the PivotTables added:
Total Revenue by Month
The number of transactions by day of the week and by hour of the day on the same sheet.
The number of transactions by product category, sorted in descending order.
The number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted in descending order, and filtered to the top 15.
- Pivot Charts are used to visualize data, and an interactive dashboard is designed to identify key insights and recommendations for the coffee shop.

## Conclusions
1. **Seasonality is consistent** – All three stores show similar monthly revenue trends, with peaks in June and lows in February.  
2. **Coffee dominates across all locations** – Coffee is the top-selling category, with Tea consistently ranking second.  
3. **Morning peak traffic is universal** – Each store has its busiest period in the morning hours (7–10 AM in Lower Manhattan, 8–10 AM in Hell's Kitchen, steady demand all day in Astoria).  
4. **Day-of-week performance varies** – While Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays are generally strong days, each store has a different “slowest” day (Sunday/Tuesday in Manhattan, Saturday in Astoria, Saturday in Hell's Kitchen).  
5. **Top beverage products differ slightly by location** –  
   - Barista Espresso is a strong performer in both Manhattan and Hell's Kitchen.  
   - Gourmet Brewed Coffee is strong in Manhattan and Astoria.  
   - Brewed Chai Tea performs especially well in Astoria and Hell's Kitchen.  
6. **Opportunities to lift evening sales** – Lower Manhattan shows weak evening transactions, suggesting after-work or evening promotions could drive growth.

## Recommendations

### Lower Manhattan
- Run **mid-winter promotions** in February to offset low sales.  
- Leverage strong Mondays and Thursdays with targeted offers.  
- Upsell during **7–10 AM morning rush**, and test **coffee happy hour** in the evening.  
- Ensure inventory and staffing cover high demand for **Barista Espresso** and **Gourmet Brewed Coffee**.

### Astoria
- Mirror Manhattan’s **seasonal campaigns** for efficiency.  
- Focus on **weekend promotions** to lift Saturday traffic.  
- Maintain consistent staffing since transactions are evenly distributed throughout the day.  
- Highlight **Brewed Chai Tea** as a unique differentiator in-store.

### Hells Kitchen
- Align with seasonal patterns observed in other stores.  
- Use **Friday specials** and **Tuesday loyalty rewards** to capitalize on high sales days.  
- Allocate staffing for **8–10 AM rush**.  
- Promote **Barista Espresso + Brewed Chai Tea combo deals** to capture top beverage demand.

### Cross-Store Strategy
- Launch **centralized seasonal campaigns** (especially in February).  
- Design **day-specific deals** (e.g., Monday motivation, Thursday boost, Friday rewards, Saturday brunch).  
- Expand **tea-focused marketing** in Astoria and Hell's Kitchen.  
- Optimize **staffing schedules** to align with peak hours at each store.  
- Test **after-work promotions** in Lower Manhattan to drive evening sales.
